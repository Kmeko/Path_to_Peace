# Path_to_Peace
Our project is a video game raising awareness about Caribbean crime. It targets younger audiences, promoting empathy, community responsibility, and conflict resolution to inspire lasting values. Accessible to all ages, the game ensures older users can also engage with its message, fostering understanding and encouraging positive change.
